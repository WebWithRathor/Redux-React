store -> where the main data is stored in the form of Object
reducer -> where number of data is store in objects for example UserActivation, products data and then they are combined and send to store
slice -> every object means data stored in reducer is known as slice and also called initial state

so cycle 

reducer -> slice -> combine data and send to store -> access in components by useSelector((=>{})) --> updated by udpate action or manipulate data by the action's

store se pure app ko cover krte h jo ki ek data k copy jo reducers m hota h toh use accses krte h or manipulate reducer se
